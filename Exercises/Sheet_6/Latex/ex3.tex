In the first case where  we would replace the 1 with a 0, the SVM wouldn't work anymore because to minimize w we could just plug in the zero vector no matter the training examples. Thus if our data is seperated is a question of poor luck.

The second case would generate us a seperating plane but it would not be optimal.
